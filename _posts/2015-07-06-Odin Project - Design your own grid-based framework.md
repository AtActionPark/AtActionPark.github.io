title: Odin Project - Design your Own Grid-Based Framework

># [Final Project: Design your Own Grid-Based Framework](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/design-your-own-grid-based-framework)
> <!--more-->
>
>In this final project, you'll get to take everything you've learned and use it to build your own simple grid-based framework.  As with the other final projects, we'll keep it relatively open-ended to give you a chance to exercise your creativity and problem-solving skills.  It will be a great project to show off to potential employers as well.
>
>Once you're done setting up your framework, you will use it to clone any website you like.  If you're out of ideas, try cloning The Odin Project!
>
>## Steps to Victory
>
>### The Framework
>
>You'll be creating your own grid-based framework.
>
>2. Follow the instructions atop the [Google Homepage project](/web-development-101/html-css) to set up a Github repository for this project (of course you'll need to change the title).
>3. Create a new CSS document.
>4. Think about the major elements that are required of a framework.  This includes a CSS reset, a fixed number of grids separated by "gutters", a way to make new rows, and default values for the font properties of elements.  
>5. Write the CSS necessary to create a basic 12-column grid framework.  Check out the [960 Grid System documentation](http://960.gs) for a look at how they do it.  The complexity is up to you -- there's no need to go too crazy with details (you're not trying to rebuild Bootstrap).  
>6. Push your framework to Github.
>
>### Applying the Framework

>1. Create a new HTML document and a new Github repository.
>1. Identify the webpage you'd like to clone and break it down into its major elements like we have in the previous projects.
>5. Add your framework to your project.
>5. Use your framework to lay out the structure of the page.
>6. Fill in the necessary details/images etc.
>7. Push your solution to Github.
>8. Have a frosty beverage, you're done with the HTML/CSS projects!


Ok so I did procrastinate, but not entirely. I kept working on the Odin project, but I also completely forgot to write some stuff about each project... Maybe this time I'll manage. Anyway this is where I am now.

So this one was pretty cool. The previous project was learning to use bootstrap to copy the [newsweek.com](http://europe.newsweek.com/) layout. It went rather smoothly, but learning parts of the framework without knowing what exacly was inside was a bit frustrating.

So I decided to code the parts of bootstrap I had been using, namely the responsive grid layout, to see if I could achieve the same result with my own framework.

Along the way I had to learn how to use sass, partial css files, and how to minify. And a new appreciation for all the work behind bootstrap.

I decided to do very little about the styling, and really concentrate on the layout.

So here is the [framework](https://github.com/AtActionPark/odin_grid_framework)

And the [result](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AtActionPark/odin_grid_framework_example/blob/master/main.html) of replacing bootstrap by my framework on the previous project. 

Pretty close, I'd say. It still miss the "switch columns" feature, but thats a problem for another day.
