So what's the point of all this? 
<!--more-->

Ok, so I'm currently learning web development through the [Odin project](http://www.theodinproject.com/home). I've done a little C# programming a few years ago, but nothing that serious. And in terms of web developement, I am starting from scratch.

But why a blog though? I dont know anything yet, and I dont particularly like the idea of putting myself out there. 

Well, I want to learn all I can, and this is a part of it. So I figured I might as well start documenting my progress, as a reminder of what I've done. 

The goal is to go through the whole curriculum and try to do a little write-up for each of the projects. If it can help someone else along the way, even better.

Maybe I'll post some other stuff when I'm confident enough, or maybe I'll give up and go back to procrastinate.

Only time will tell.

If I had to put money on it though, I'd bet on procrastination. Thats always a safe bet.
