Well, looks like it works. Yay!

Here's what I did.


1. Install the jekyll gem
3. Create github repository called userName.github.io
4. Clone [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) repo and push it to newly created repo
5. Clone my new repo delete post, replace info, and create first new post


I added Disqus comments, following the method in [this post](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/2014/06/29/adding-disqus-to-your-jekyll-powered-github-pages).

I also installed the rouge gem, to help with ruby syntax highligting. The only thing to do was to change the _config.yml to show: *highlighter: rouge* and rebuild with *jekyll build*

So does the code highlighter work?

{% highlight ruby %}
def update
  @user = User.find(params[:id])
  if @user.update(user_params)
    redirect_to edit_user_path(@user)
  else
    render :edit
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Yep!

EDIT: Since 08/15 rouge breaks deployment to github. It needs to be replaced by pygments, the procedure can be found [here](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/3-syntax-highlighting/). Its a bit more work though.

Finally I followed [this post](http://code.antrikshy.com/show-post-excerpts-on-poole-blog-homepage/) by Antriksh to show post excerpts on the homepage instead of the whole post.

Even for a novice that was relatively painless.
